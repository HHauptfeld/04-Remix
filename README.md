Assignment 4 - DataVis Remix + Multiple Views
===

Project Description
---
Link to visualization hosted on gh-pages: 
http://haleyhauptfeld.com/04-Remix/index.html

Original visualization: https://wid.world/country/usa/

The data I chose to remix is the income inequality within the USa from 1913-2019.


Technical Achievement
---
I added a third visualization of the given data using a scatterplot.

Design Achievement
---
I added titles to the x-axis and y-axis of each visualization to clarify what they represent.

Incorporating a brief writeup with your remix is a good idea.
Communicate what the original vis was, what the major issues were, and what new things can be seen with your redesign.
You could have text directly on the page, an "info" button, an about page, etc.

Requirements
---

0. Your code should be forked from the GitHub repo and linked using GitHub pages.
1. Your project should load a dataset you found on the web from the vis you're remixing. You may extract the data by sight if necessary. Put this file in your repo.
2. Your project should use d3 to build a visualization of the dataset. 
3. Your writeup (readme.md in the repo) should contain the following:

- Working link to the visualization hosted on gh-pages or other external sources.
- Concise description and screenshot of your visualization.
- Description of the technical achievements you attempted with this visualization.
- Description of the design achievements you attempted with this visualization.
